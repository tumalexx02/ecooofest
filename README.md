# ECO-FEST LANDING PAGE
My first HTML / SCSS / JS landing page project, it was created for ECO-FEST case championship. After taking courses at Udemy on basic web development, I decided to try to implement the first project. After that, my first customer wrote to me and asked for help in creating a landing page, and my first project appeared.

In this project, I tried to hone my HTML and CSS layout skills, also using the SCSS preprocessor for more convenient styling. The layout was done according to the BEM methodology. There was also a goal to get acquainted with JavaScript at the initial level by adding simple interactive elements.

The customer was satisfied with the work, and I fulfilled my goals ✌(ツ)
